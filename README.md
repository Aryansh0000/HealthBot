A client-server interface for patients to communicate to doctors via text.

Abstract:

The main objective of this project is to reduce the cost and time for patients to get a response on the question, than the response that is obtained from a man-made machine."

The Live-Chats are the computer programs that interact with the users by connecting them to a network of available doctors for consultation and appointments. 

This enables the patient to ask simple doubts and clarifications , be it regarding illness or medication and be answered within minutes at the comfort of being at home without visiting all the way to a clinic or hospital.

Introduction:

Research says 60% of visits to a doctors are for simple small-scale diseases, 80% of which can be cured at home using simple home remedies.

These diseases mostly include common cold and cough, headache, abdominal pains, etc. They may be caused due to the changes in the weather, intake of improper diet, fatigue, etc. and can be cured without visiting a doctor all the way to the clinic.

There are a number of live-chats which provide services for the healthcare domain. Work is being carried out to enable the patient to communicate in a way similar to the communication carried out between two humans in physical mode. 

Conclusion:

A huge amount of cost and time for patients can be reduced by implementing a Live-Chat system with trained and verified doctors on your phone, laptops, etc. 

And to get the response on the question asked, the patient doesnâ€™t even require to strain a muscle to visit a hospital or a clinic , he can just connect with a doctor online.

This would help patient avoid long waiting lines for mildest of issues and consultation and also would ultimately benefit doctors to save their time for more complex and important health-related cases.
